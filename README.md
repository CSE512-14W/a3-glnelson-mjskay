## Scotch Flavor Explorer

Our visualization is intended to allow people to explore scotches by similarity, while also seeing geographic patterns in flavors. 

The user can explore the "flavor space" by selecting a scotch to compare against (perhaps one they are familiar with, or particularly enjoy). They can then see the
most and least similar scotches to it alongside a map of scotland with the distilleries marked. Each distillery point size is proportional to its similarity
to the selected scotch (try Ardbeg to see a fairly unique one!). The user can also filter the dataset by particular flavors they might be interested in
by clicking on column headers.  

## Running Instructions

If your visualization is web-based,  it would be great if your submissions can be opened online. [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) is a good and easy way to put your visualization online so you can put your link here.  For example:

Access our visualization at http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mjskay/cse512/a3-glnelson-mjskay/www/ or download this repository and run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9000` and access this from http://localhost:9000/www/.

## Story Board

Storyboard is available [here](storyboard.pdf?raw=true).


### Changes between Storyboard and the Final Implementation

We originally imagined more intuitive interactions for filtering, but did not have time to implement these, opting instead for a "quick-n-dirty" click-column-header-to-cycle-mode interaction.

## Development Process

Include:
- Breakdown of how the work was split among the group members. 
- a commentary on the development process, including answers to the following questions: 
  - Roughly how much time did you spend developing your application?
  - What aspects took the most time?
